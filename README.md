# delete-files-older-than-x
I use this to filter my cPanel and Wordpress backups and delete ones older than a certain amount of days

Its pretty self-explanitory to customize and i just have it set to automatically run on my windows server, however, to set it up for auto run the "pause" lines must be removed otherwise it will hang
